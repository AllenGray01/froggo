### What is Froggo Grinder?  
Froggo Grinder is a free and open-source [Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol) selfbot!  
Froggo is designed to get as much XP as possible, as fast as possible.   
That way you can get all the sweet leveling rewards!  
  
  
### Will I get banned for using Froggo?  
Technically, any kind of automation of a normal user account is against Discord's TOS ([Support Article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-)).  However, they will not actively go looking for userbots / selfbots, so they are unlikely to get banned if they don't stress the API (which Froggo does not). So you are most likely to be fine.  
Being blacklisted from Dank Memer is a different question. I have used this bot to get an account to level 3k+,  
so you'll probably be fine, as it is designed to look like a human.  
  
### Where can I download it?  
Nowhere yet, there will be a download link once Froggo is released!  
  
### How do I get the most XP?  
Since a recent update Dank Memer gives double XP on weekends. This makes them the perfect opportunity for the bot! Make sure to give it pizza slices and/or daily boxes for the fastest possible grinding. You can also make the account it's running on eat cheese for an extra XP multi. With ~20 cheese eaten, pizzas and daily boxes the bot can get up to 600 levels in around 8-10 hours!
